## Q & A

#### Why are the TLA+ files Unicode-based?

In short, Unicode-based has better readability rather than plain ASCII.

In the plain ASCII, many other projects will generate a styled PDF with the
TLA+ files for readability, there are some disadvantages:
+ PDF files don't work well with git
+ (PDF)Latex dependency
+ More efforts to sync the TLA+ files and PDF files

#### How do I input the Unicode symbols?
